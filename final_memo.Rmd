Overview of dataset
- The dataset includes a lot of important information about determining when hotel booking is really popular, which contains a lot of nonnumerical and numerical variables, such at the time of booking and how for how many people. 
- I would be obtaining the dataset from Kaggle and I could just download it from there. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand
- There are around 119,390 observations and about 32 predictors. 
- I would be working with a mix of categorical, numerical, binary, and non-categorical variables. 
- There are missing data, like a lot for certain variables like reservation status and if a company made the booking. I plan to maybe ignore them since it isn't really relevant to what I'm looking for, but if it a big problem, I may need to exclude them or not use the variable. 

Overview of research question(s):
- I am interested in predicting what time of the year is when people begin to book hotels. My question is what is the busiest time for hotel bookings?
- My response variables are the total number (count) of day (arrival_date_day_of_month), week (arrival_date_week_number), month (arrival_date_month), and year (arrival_date_year) of the time of the hotel booking. 
- My question would be best answered with a classification approach.
- I think the predictors are the date the person booked their hotel. 
- It would be of a descriptive and inferential approach. I already have the data at hand so I am not predicting anything. I am trying to analyze when certain people book hotels at certain time (inferential) and also seeing the visual relationship between the response and predictor values, 

Proposed project timeline:
- I plan to have my data set loaded by next week. I will begin the writing specific questions that could be responded by this dataset by week 3. Week 4-5 should be cleaning the data. Week 6-8 would be focusing on exploratory data analysis. Week 9 would be making charts and graphs. Week 10 would be revisions and making sure everything works well. 

Any questions and concerns:
- I needed help cleaning up the data and dealing with variables that have a lot of missing values. No other questions.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
